%This project report is written as a 4th semester project during the spring semester of 2020 as part of the programme in Mathematics-Economics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. The overall topic of the report is \textit{Mathematical Modelling in Finance} with a focus on how expected utility theory can be used in the insurance markets.  

%The project is composed of numbered chapters with corresponding sections and subsections. Citations and external references are made using the Vancouver system such that \cite[p.~10]{axler} refers to page 10 of the first entry in the bibliography. All programming is performed using R, and the R-code can be found in the appendices at the end of the report. 

This project report is written as a 9th semester project during the autumn semester of 2023 as part of the Master's programme in Mathematics-Economics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University.
%This project report is written as a 6th semester project during the spring semester of 2021 as part of the programme in Mathematics-Economics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. 

%The overall topic of the report is \textit{Statistical Modelling and Analysis} with a focus on how statical theory and data analysis can be utilized to determine the comorbidities of COVID-19.

The project is composed of two main parts with corresponding sections and subsections. Citations and external references are made using the Vancouver system such that \cite[p.~10]{bollerslev} refers to page 10 of the first entry in the bibliography. All programming is performed using R and Python, and the code can be found at the following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/cbje18/P9}.
